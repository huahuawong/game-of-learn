game-of-learn
=============

This repository contains a series of Conway's Game of Life implementations in different languages. The objective of this repository is to share my experience of learning new programming languages.

People normally code a 'Hello, World!' to start, I prefer to code a Conway's Game of Life implementation. Why? Because it is a more complex algorithm, so I can explore more advanced feature of the languages.

## Avaliable Languages

* [Go](go/README.md)

## Planed Languages

Known:

* C
* C++
* Python
* JS

Will be learned:

* Rust
* Elixir
* Haskell
