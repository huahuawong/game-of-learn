game-of-learn
=============

This repository contains a series of Conway's Game of Life implementations in different languages. The objective of this repository is to share my experience of learning new programming languages.

To start learning people normally write a 'Hello, World!' code, I prefer to write an Conway's Game of Life implementation. Why? Because it is a more complex algorith, so I can explore more advanced feature of the languages.

## Avaliable Languages

* [Go](go/README.md)

## Planed Languages

Known:

* C
* C++
* Python
* JS

Will be learned:

* Rust
